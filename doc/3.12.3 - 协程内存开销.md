# 协程内存开销

新版本`4.0`使用了`C`栈+`PHP`栈的协程实现方案。`Server`程序每次请求的事件回调函数中会创建一个新协程，处理完成后协程退出。

在协程创建时需要创建一个全新的内存段作为`C`和`PHP`的栈，底层默认分配`2M(C)`虚拟内存+`8K(PHP)`内存（`PHP-7.2`或更高版本）。实际并不会分配这么内存，系统会根据在内存实际读写时发生缺页中断，再分配实际内存。

> 由于`PHP-7.1/7.0`未提供设置栈内存尺寸的接口，这些版本每个协程将申请`256K`的`PHP`内存

相比于异步回调程序，协程会增加一些内存管理的开销。有一定性能损耗。经过压测`QPS`依然可以达到较高的水平。
